# Noololly's website

This is the repository for my new website. It may not be much, but its my first venture outside of boilerplate HTML

# Making a build environment

If, for some reason, you want to contribute to my website of nothingness, you can make a dev environment as follows:

Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/noololly/site.git
cd site
```
Install the packages and run
```bash
npm install
npm start
```
